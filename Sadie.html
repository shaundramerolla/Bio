          Sadie is a mix of American Staffordshire Terrier, Catahoula Leopard Dog, and Bulldog.
          A true American Mutt!
          </p>
          <p>
          The AmStaff is an American breed, related to the Bulldog and Bull Terrier. 
          Although often considered at Pitbull breed, the AmStaff is intelligent, outgoing, good-natured, 
          confident, and affectionate. Though they look tough, 
          they would rather play, and explore than be tough.  
          </p>
          <p>
          The Catahoula Leopard Dog, or Catahoula Cur, is a hound dog developed in Lousianna 
          to drive and track cattle and feral hogs. They are intelligent, loyal, independent, 
          protective, entertaining, and unyielding in their work
          </p>
          <p>
          The Bulldog is kind and resolute. Originally bred as a bullbaiting dog, 
          they are courageous, but generally docile and often lazy. They can be stubborn,
          but are usually calm and love people.
          </p>
          <p>
          True to her breed(s), Sadie is intelligent, outgoing, and confident with an unyielding energy.
          She will play ball all day, but also loves to be around us, 
          and snuggle up on the couch. 
          </p>
