      <h2>Technical & Work Experience</h2>
        
        <p>My early career experience sparked an interest in digital and mobile technology.
        I decided to pursue a Masters in Information Systems at Boston University, 
        concentrating in Web App Development.
        MET CS 601 (in which this website was designed) is my 5th class towards my masters. 
        I have also completed the following:</p>
