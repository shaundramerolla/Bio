        <p>
        Born and raised in Massachusetts, I grew up in a small town northwest of Boston,
	      <a href="https://www.shirley-ma.gov/about-shirley" target="_blank">Shirley</a>, Massachusetts, population 7000.
        I attended the University of Rhode Island, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.
        I spent my first few years in the workforce in IT Deployment and Marketing at a fortune 100 company in Boston's Metrowest.
        I currently work as an Analyst, managing mobile app and delivery content for the Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins menu.

        In my free time, I work on fixing up an old Dutch Colonial (circa 1910) my husband and I bought two years ago.
        We now live in Attleboro with our dog named Sadie. She's a (very spoiled) rescue from Tennessee.
        When I find free time I enjoy cooking, traveling, and listening to music.
